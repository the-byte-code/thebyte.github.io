      <description>Climate Change is a huge global issue that we are currently experiencing on the planet. It’s been a huge problem known for decades but only now are we actually seeing the effects of it on the news. From devastating wildfires to powerful surges of floods. We are living dangerously close to the point of no return, so close to the start of mass extinctions. So how can we solve this?</description>

      <title>Nuclear Power: Are we playing with fire?</title>

      <description>Nuclear Power is a clean and remarkably efficient way of boiling water (the steam formed turn turbines) to produce electricity. Currently, this scaled-up, over-complicated kettle powers 20% of the United Kingdom. One Kilogram of Uranium can generate the same amount of power that it would take 126 gallons of oil, 1 ton of coal or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas to generate. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear fuel does not release large quantities of harmful emissions into our atmosphere.</description>

      <description>We live in a vast, beautiful world teeming with life – Intelligent life. We are the most intelligent beings in our world. Does this make it right for us to be cruel to less intelligent life forms? Why must intelligent animals die in order for us to live?&#xA;Last year, around 6.4 billion land animals and sea creatures were killed in the uk for food. Around 70 billion land animals were killed for food globally in total last year.</description>

      <description>Hi, hello, thank you for joining Rosshall Records! By now you’ve probably been debriefed by me (Akrit) or Miss Rowbottom in person or over a teams call about what this club is about and what you do in it. This post is basically a quick ‘cheat sheet’ on things you may have forgotten or misunderstood when you were debriefed. (By the way, before we begin, if you’ve not had your debriefing with us then don’t worry, it should be soon!</description>
